.SH NAME
xhidecursor \- hide the mouse cursor when typing

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xhidecursor

.SH DESCRIPTION
xhidecursor hides the mouse cursor when a key is pressed and shows it again
when the mouse is moved. It uses the XFixes extension and implements only the
minimal required event handling. Compared to xbanish (nearly 500 lines of
code), xhidecursor is much smaller (~40 lines) and uses less CPU.

.SH USAGE
xhidecursor runs in the background for the duration of the X session. To
start it automatically:

.nf
    xhidecursor &
.fi

Place this line in ~/.xinitrc or your window manager startup file.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
The XFixes extension must be available on the X server.

.SH SEE ALSO
